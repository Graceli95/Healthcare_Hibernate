package com.healthcare.repository;

/*
Path: com.healthcaremanagement.repository
Class Name: DoctorRepositoryImpl
Methods:
Create Method: void createDoctor(Doctor doctor)
Use Hibernateâ€™s session.save(doctor) method to insert a new doctor into the Doctors table.
Transaction: Wrap the save operation in a transaction (Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction(); transaction.commit();). This ensures that the database operation is atomic.
Read Method: Doctor getDoctorById(int doctorId)
Use session.get(Doctor.class, doctorId) to retrieve a doctor by ID. This method returns null if the entity is not found.
No transaction is needed for this read operation, but you must ensure the session is properly opened and closed.
Update Method: void updateDoctor(Doctor doctor)
Use session.update(doctor) to update the existing doctor details in the database.
Transaction: Like the create method, wrap the update operation in a transaction to ensure changes are persisted correctly.
Delete Method: void deleteDoctor(int doctorId)
Use session.delete(doctor) to remove a doctor from the database.
Transaction: Deletion should also be wrapped in a transaction.
List All Method: List<Doctor> getAllDoctors()
Use HQL: session.createQuery("from Doctor", Doctor.class).list() to retrieve all doctors.
No transaction is needed for this operation, but ensure the session is opened and closed properly.
Good to Know:

Transactions: Always start a transaction before making changes to the database and commit after the operation to ensure data integrity.
HQL vs. SQL: Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is similar to SQL but operates on entities rather than tables, making it more object-oriented.
Session Management: Make sure to open and close sessions properly to avoid memory leaks.

                       //This prevents Hibernate from trying to delete the associated Office (if it's not supposed to be deleted).
                    session.merge(doctor.getOffice()); //is used to update the detached Office entity before the Doctor is removed.
                    //The Office entity was retrieved as part of Doctor, but since it is not managed in the current session, it is detached.
                    //session.merge(doctor.getOffice()); ensures the Office entity is reattached to the session so that Hibernate can update it (doctor field set to null) before committing.

    /**
     * Why is session.merge() Needed?
     * Hibernate follows a session scope model, meaning:
     *
     * 1. Entities fetched in a session are in a "persistent" state (tracked by Hibernate).
     * 2. Entities retrieved before a session begins are "detached" and need to be "reattached" using merge().
     * Since we retrieved Office via Doctor but didn't explicitly fetch it in the session, it is in a detached state.
     * Calling merge():
     *
     * 1. Reattaches Office to the session.
     * 2. Applies the update (doctor set to null).
     * 3. Prevents "detached entity passed to persist" error.
